The Bot will have to traverse through various difficult terrains to reach its destination within minimum time.

Rules and Regulations :

Team may consist of maximum 4 members.
Every team will be provided with 1000 protons (protons=currency of the event)
Total time limit is 20 minutes for implementing in arena \u0026 45 min for making the bot.
Bonus point will be credited for remaining time (remaining time in sec.* 1) points.
Extra bonus will be credited for saving virtual money as (remaining money * 2) points.
The Maximum voltage allowable between any two points on the bot is 24 V DC.
50 points will be credited after crossing each obstacles.
For dragging each box to the finish line 50 points will be credited but the boxes can not go out of the arena.

Event Description

In this event, the bot has to complete a path [starting from one point \u0026 ending at another point] inside a metallic arena full of water, while being floated and performing basic tasks in water. The tasks may vary from just maneuvering the bot according to the path, hitting the switches \u0026 ringing the buzzers etc. The tasks will get much more challenging and interesting in further rounds. This event gives emphasis on the agility, strength and stability of the bot in water when subjected to perform different tasks in different rounds. Our event ensures that the best bot wins.


Round 1 :
In this preliminary round, a bot has to travel in the specified path as directed in figure above. The path is surrounded on both sides by red walls which run the entire path.
The red wall has a height of 4 inches above the surface of water and is submerged to another 4 inches below the surface of water.
A bot will have to start from point A, manoeuvre through the whole path , perform few tasks at some different locations of the path and reach the ending point B of the path.
A bot have to touch the cylinder and pull out the balls and take them to the ending point. Each ball carries 50 points.
The time given to finish the whole task for Round 1 is 3 minutes.
The time needed to finish the whole task will be subtracted from the net score amounting at the end of the task. Each second equals 2 point.

General Rule :

Each group should consists of maximum number of 4 members.
One bot cannot be shared by two different teams.
No one participant can't be part of two different teams.

Event Description

Explore the thrill of soccer, the challenge of team co-ordination, your skills of control over the bot \u0026 your limit to resist the pressure and deliver at the same time. In this event, teams have to try to score goals against their opponents\u0026 save their goal at the same time. Extend your imagination in gameplay and tactics. If you think you are up to the mark Ro-Soccer is the platform for robotics enthusiasts like you.

Objective

EACH TEAM WOULD HAVE TWO MANUAL BOTS, ONE AS DEFENDER AND THE OTHER AS STRIKER. EACH TEAM WILL COMPETE WITH ANOTHER TEAM ALSO HAVING TWO BOTS. THE FIRST ROUND WOULD BE THE PRELIMS \u0026 AT THE END OF THE PRELIMS, DEPENDING UPON THE SCORE, TEAMS WILL QUALIFY TO THE NEXT ROUND.

ABOUT KHET:
The Laser Game KHET 2.0: Mind blowing laser fun for players ages 9-99. Using simple rules that can be learned in minutes, players alternate turns moving Egyptian themed mirrored Pieces, after which they fire their REAL (eye-safe) laser with the goal of blasting their opponents PHARAOH to win the game! BASIC GEOMETRICAL CONCEPT IS THE KEY FACTOR IN THIS GAME. 

KEY NAMES:
•	PHARAOH(1): The Pharaoh(The King) is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game.
•	SCARAB(2): Scarabs consist primarily of dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board.
•	ANUBIS(2): They have the advantage that, despite being unmirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides to be eliminated.
•	PYRAMID(7): Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides.
•	SPHINX(1): Sphinxes hold the lasers. They can rotate in two directions only. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself.


BASIC GUIDELINES:
•	Two players will play in one set at a time. (3 sets are available)
•	In each turn a player will get a maximum of two minutes and for the next minute a negative point will be added. Maximum time limit is 3 minutes.
•	If he/she does not make any move within the stipulated time, then and there he/she will be eliminated and opponent shall be declared as winner.
•	A maximum of three warnings will be given for breaking any rule with a negative point.
•	Negative points will be the measure for breaking tie-ups, if any.
•	Mirrors of the pieces must not be touched. 


RULES:
•	PHARAOH: The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. Similar to a king in chess, the Pharaoh pieces are comparatively weak, and so are often not moved unless under duress.
•	SCARABS: Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. Also, unlike other pieces, Scarabs may move into an adjacent square even if it is already occupied, by switching places with the piece found there (whichever color it may be). Thus, they are the most powerful pieces on the board, but must be used with care, as a move that puts one side of the mirror in a favorable position may expose the player to attack using the opposite side of the same mirror.
•	SPHINXES: In Khet 2.0, the Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each player's is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself.
•	ANUBES: Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being unmirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.
•	PYRAMIDS: Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides, and must be defended lest the player lose their ability to build paths of any size.

 	Mirrors of the pieces must not be touched.


ROUNDS:
•	PRELIMS: With the CLASSIC model, the prelims will be held and based on prelims eight participants will be selected.
•	SEMIS: In the Semis, the eight selected players will play and four winners will battle out for the final. IMHOTEP model will be used.
•	FINAL: In the final, no time limit will be there and from them one will be declared winner. Model DYNASTY will be implemented.

The bots need to enter the arena after climbing the inclined plane through the flap gates. 150 points will be given for this. 
If a bot is put in the ditch inside the arena by the opponent it will give the opponent full 300 points. If the bot is thrown out of the arena it will give the opponent full 100 points . And for the ditch at the boundary, it will give 200 points.
